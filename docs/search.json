The Impact of Universal Guideline Adherence and Provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act on Financial Toxicity Among Medicare Beneficiaries. Bars represent the proportion of Medicare beneficiaries facing catastrophic health expenditures (&gt;20% of income). Left: Baseline toxicity under current utilization. Middle: Toxicity under ‘Universal GDMT’ (quadruple therapy), showing a surge in drug costs (Orange). Right: Toxicity after applying the IRA’s $2,000 pharmacy cap (Green), showing a reduction in drug-attributable toxicity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2. Heterogeneity in Policy Impact: Reductions in Financial Toxicity by Demographic Subgroup Under the Inflation Reduction Act. The dumbbell plot illustrates the prevalence of financial toxicity under Universal GDMT (Orange) versus the Post-IRA Scenario (Green). The length of the grey connector indicates the magnitude of the absolute risk reduction. Note the substantial reductions for Black beneficiaries and Mid-Income patients, contrasting with negligible changes for Hispanic and High-Income groups.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3. The Equity Paradox: Distribution of Insurance Coverage Across Demographic Subgroups Explaining Differential Policy Impact. Bars represent the proportion of patients within each demographic subgroup covered by specific insurance types. Green bars (Medicare IRA Beneficiary) indicate patients who benefit from the cap. Blue bars (Medicaid/Dual) and Grey bars (Uninsured) represent patients unaffected by Part D reform. The high proportion of Medicaid/Uninsured status among Hispanic and Low-Income patients explains the minimal impact of the IRA observed in these groups.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupplementary Table 1.
